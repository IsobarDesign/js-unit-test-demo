JS Unit-Test Demo

I.Overwiev 

This is a small demo project to show how I approach unit testing in JavaScript using Jest.
It includes basic math functions (add and subtract) with tests covering valid and invalid inputs.

Features

math.js – simple functions with input validation.

math.test.js – unit tests using Jest, checking multiple cases including error scenarios.

Demo console outputs – run node math.js to see example results in the console.

II.Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone [your-repo-link]
cd js-unit-test-demo


Install dependencies:

npm install


Run tests:

npm test


Run demo console output:

node math.js


You will see example outputs for both valid and invalid inputs, like:

=== Math.js Demo ===
add(2, 3) = 5
subtract(5, 2) = 3
add('a', 3) = NaN
subtract(undefined, 2) = NaN
==================

Notes

This is a simple example for demonstration purposes.

The project showcases my approach to coding and unit testing in JavaScript.
